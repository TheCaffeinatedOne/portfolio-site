         as it is very hard to get to know a person in a paragraph or two, so ill tell you what you <i>need</i> to know about me. i am 13 years old, and have been coding for 5 years now. i started with html, css, and Js which are you front end fundamentals to make everything you see in front of you. two years later, i joined my coding club and began to learn java taught be Dimitri Volkov, and Aiden Flaherty, one more after

    <h2>what do we do?</h2>
      <h3>one person gig</h3>
      there are many projects that you can embark on with our gigs by your side. for example; only our software person, TheCaffeinatedOne has to build you a site if you want no pictures, or have your own. in fact he is writing this paragraph(and this third person perspective is gonna mess me up after). for art, you can have our artist Nuggie(short for nugget), make you a logo, banner or even commission of you choice. as it normally is with art, you can do whatever you want. and last but not least, Mr.Cursith, our hardware expert, can do anything from repair your hardware problem, to turning old hardware into your own personal home server.
