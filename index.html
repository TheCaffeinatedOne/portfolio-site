       <div class="whySite">
         <h2>who am i?</h2>
         as it is very hard to get to know a person in a paragraph or two, so ill tell you what you <i>need</i> to know about me. i am 13 years old,
          and have been programming for 5 years now. i started with html, css, and Js which are you front end fundamentals to make everything you
          see in front of you. two years later, i joined my coding club and began to learn java taught be Dimitri Volkov, and Aiden Flaherty,
          one year later and im learning advanced javascript. then we ended up in quarrentine. i taught myself c# to try to learn game development,
          but so far i have only learned microsoft's .NET framework. im sure Unity framework isnt hard to learn, but i havent had the time to do that
          as i had embarked on new projects, i finally learned how to use linux. i learned by booting a usb hard drive, and i am writing this on in it.
          i am currently uding ubuntu but plan on switching to majaro. some of my endeavours arent listed here, so please go to <a href="about.html">here</a> for more details.

  <div class="whyMe">
    <h2>what do i do?</h2>
    currently i have no idea. im just focusing on school. but what this site is a reflection of is my desire to lay down a foundation for something
     bigger when im older. and, as it stands at the moment, i can only make $20 a month. so im trying to make money, and im trying to make money
     so i can play with my friends, because all i have is a cheap laptop with onboard graphics. i can barely run games to play with my friends.
     so, in short; what i am doing with this portfolio site is trying to make money, and secure my future.
