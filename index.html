      <h2>who am i?</h2>
      As it is very hard to get to know a person in a paragraph or two, I'll tell you what you <i>need</i> to know about me. I am 13 years old.
      and have programmed for 4 years now. I started with html, css, and Js which are "front end" fundamentals to make everything you
      see in front of you. Three years later, I joined my coding club and began to learn java. i was taught by two high schoolers Dimitri Volkov, and Aiden Flaherty.
      one year later and I'm learning JavaScript intended for web apps. Then we ended up in quarantine. I taught myself c# to try to learn game development,
      but so far i have only learned Microsoft's .NET framework. im sure the Unity framework isn't hard to learn, but I havent had the time to do that
      as I had embarked on new projects, like learning how to use Linux. I learned by booting a usb hard drive, and I am writing this on in it.
      I am using Ubuntu but plan on switching to Manjaro. Some of my other shenanigans aren't listed here, so please go to <a href="about.html">here</a> for more details.

      <h2>what do i do?</h2>
      Currently I have no idea. im just focusing on school. But this site reflects my wish to lay down a foundation for something
      bigger when im older. Another reason is that as it stands at the moment, I can only make $20 each month. so I'm trying to make money
      so I can play with my friends, because all I have is a cheap laptop with onboard graphics. I can barely run games to play with my friends.
      so, in short; what I am doing with this portfolio site is trying to make money, and secure my future.
