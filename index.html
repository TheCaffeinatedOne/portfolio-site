         <h2>who am i?</h2>
         As it is very hard to get to know a person in a paragraph or two, I'll tell you what you <i>need</i> to know about me. I am 13 years old.
          and have been programming for 5 years now. I started with html, css, and Js which are "front end" fundamentals to make everything you
          see in front of you. Three years later, I joined my coding club and began to learn java. i was taught by two high schoolers Dimitri Volkov, and Aiden Flaherty.
          one year later and I'm learning javascript intended for web apps. Then we ended up in quarrentine. I taught myself c# to try to learn game development,
          but so far i have only learned microsoft's .NET framework. im sure the Unity framework isn't hard to learn, but I havent had the time to do that
          as I had embarked on new projects, like learning how to use linux. I learned by booting a usb hard drive, and I am writing this on in it.
          I am currently using Ubuntu but plan on switching to Manjaro. Some of my other shenanigans arent listed here, so please go to <a href="about.html">here</a> for more details.

    <h2>what do i do?</h2>
    Currently I have no idea. im just focusing on school. But what this site is a reflection of is my desire to lay down a foundation for something
     bigger when im older. As it stands at the moment, I can only make $20 a month. so I'm trying to make money, and I'm trying to make money
     so I can play with my friends, because all I have is a cheap laptop with onboard graphics. I can barely run games to play with my friends.
     so, in short; what i am doing with this portfolio site is trying to make money, and secure my future.
