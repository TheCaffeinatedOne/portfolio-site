    <h2>The long answer</h2>
      as mentioned before i have been coding for 4 years. what i did specifically is above this paragraph. this is meant to clear up any
       confusion about specific things. so the first languages i learnt was html, css, and js. this was meant for sites, and they werent
       good or useful because I was, well 9. I soon got into middle school, and joined the newly formed coding club started by
       other 6th graders. i wouldnt say i founded it, i was just there when it started. there, learned java using a site called repl.it .
       i learned from two highschoolers who taught it in an easy to understand and nice manner, i would even say they were on par with my
        actual school teachers, maybe even better. i came back the next year to learn javascript with the purpose of webapps, and in between classes and schoolwork,
       i learned batch scripts, which are windows terminal automation scripts, used in some apps to make edits to the pc, as one would imagine,
       you can do some spooky stuff with it. i found a way to make a script that just turns your computer off when you turn it on, by saving itself
        to run on startup, you would imagine the problem, I began to learn c# for using the unity game engine to make games. but the
       only tutorials worth a look were ones by microsoft for their .NET framework. this was a minor setback,as I now need to learn the unity framework,
       which includes a different set of objects for object orriented programming which is what most of the languages ive learned are. i also learned
       how to make discord bots which has two spots because I had to learn node.js which is a framework that can run on a desktop, and i also had to
       learn discord.js which was a varient of node.js. soon after, i switched to linux. where i had to learn the terminal. i then learned wifi hacking
       to better secure my wifi network and to get my brother to leave me alone. most recently me and my friend who specializes in hardware, created a
       server. we are now learning to port forward so i can connect to the server at his house from my house. find out what im learning as i learn it <a href="blog.html">here</a>
