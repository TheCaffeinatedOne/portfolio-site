    <h2>in more detail</h2>
      as mentioned before i have been coding for 5 years. what i did specifically is above this paragraph. this is meant to clear up any
       confusion about specific things. so the first languages i learnt was html, css, and js. this was meant to be ran on a web browser
       and to the extent of my knowledge it has been. i soon got into middle school, and joined the newly formed coding club started by
       other 6th graders. there i learned java in a shell application framework. i learned from two highschoolers who taught it in an
       easy to understand and nice manner, i would even say they were on par with my actual school teachers, maybe even better. i came back
       the next year to learn javascript with the purpose of webapps, and in those two years before quarrentine struck, i learned, batch scripts,
       which are windows terminal automation scripts, used in some apps to make edits to the pc, as one would imagine, you can do some spooky stuff
       with it. i found a way to make a script that just turns your computer off when you turn it on, by saving itself to run on startup, and
       giving it a command to shut the computer off. so during quarrentine, i began to learn c# for using the unity game engine to make games. but the
       only tutorials worth a look were ones by microsoft for their .NET framework. this was a minor setback,as i now need to learn the unity framework,
       which includes a different set of objects for object orriented programming which is what most of the languages ive learned are. i also learned
       how to make discord bots which has two spots because i had to learn node.js which is a framework that can run on a desktop, and i also had to
       learn discord.js which was a varient of node.js. soon after, i switched to linux. where i had to learn the terminal. i then learned wifi hacking
       to better secure my wifi network and to get my brother to leave me alone. most recently me and my friend who specializes in hardware, created a
       server. we are now learning to port forward so i can connect to the server at his house from my house.
